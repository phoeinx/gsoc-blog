title: GSoC 23 - A Contributors' Experience
---

Hi there! 

I am phoeinx, a Computer Science student from Germany who has been selected for a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) project and will contribute to MariaDB Columnstore during this summer.

This blog serves as a progress tracker of things that I learnt, coded and felt challenged by. Have a look around!
